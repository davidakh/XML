# XML
XML is a artificial intelligence that is based on ChatGPT 2 124m model.

# Important Considerations
    •   XML does not always give accurate answers.
    •   XML has currently been trained on the Wikipedia dataset, books by J.R.R. Tolkien, and texts by Shakespeare.
    •   XML does not currently utilize GPU architectures such as Nvidia's CUDA or AMD's ROCm.
    •   XML throttles training speed to relieve CPU/GPU from the intensive process. To turn of throttling you must manually change the bool state in train.py.
